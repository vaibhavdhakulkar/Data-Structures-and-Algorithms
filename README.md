# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms – Daily Practice Repository
## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my daily practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
Each problem is solved with a clear approach, well-structured code, and simple explanations to help understand the logic step by step.

## The main purpose of this repository is:
- To improve my problem-solving and coding skills
- To build strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms
- To create a reference resource for students and developers preparing for coding interviews
- To maintain consistency through daily problem-solving practice

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Practice at least one DSA problem daily
- Write clean, readable, and optimized code
- Understand time and space complexity
- Organize problems topic-wise for easy reference
- Share knowledge with other learners

## 🧠 Topics Covered
This repository includes problems from the following topics:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hashing
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
(More topics will be added as learning progresses.)

## Each folder contains:
- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Code implementation
(Optional) Time & Space complexity

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools Used
- Python (primary language)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

## ✍️ How Problems Are Added
For every problem, the following details are included:
- Problem description
- Approach / logic used
- Code solution
